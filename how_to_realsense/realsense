first step
1.buy realsense
2.go to intel realsense ros repo
3.download and roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch

second step
in order to use tag to know about its distance
1.need apriltag ros repo (create new ws)
2.before catkin_make apriltag ros repo ,we also need AprilTag library, or we will catkin_make fail
3.so go to download AprilTag library (put anywhere,after make install ,which can delete),mkdir name "build" folder
4.cd to build ,and cmake .. (which will check if all request ,which you must have)
5.if above ok,sudo make install
6.library complie file ,will name .so (which like ubuntu class)

third step
1.go apriltag ros ws
2.source devel/setup.bash
3.before roslaunch ,we need modify orginal continuous_detection.launch

  row 4,5 modify as below,because the class input topic is '/camera/color/image_raw' & '/camera/color/camera_info'
  arg name is variable in that script,rear replace front
  <arg name="camera_name" default="/camera/color" />
  <arg name="image_topic" default="image_raw" />

4.go to config ->tags.yaml
  
  copy row 19 to row 24 ,which means tell the apriltag real world tag size, which can inverse calculate the distance to user

5.roslaunch apriltag_ros continuous_detection.launch
